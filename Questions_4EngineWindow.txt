What is a precompiled header? Name pros and cons:
	A header file that has been preprocessed for the compiler to work faster.
	The more files are included in the program, the more time can be saved.
	On the other side, as soon as the precompiled header is edited everything
	has to be recompiled as well.
	
Describe the layer of abstraction with your own words:
	A layer of abstraction is a part which is built in between two
	other parts to mask the additional effort to do something.
	Often they are wrappers around some library or other part that
	hide parts of the library which are not important for the user.
	
Name the SOLID principles and describe them briefly:
	SINGLE-RESPONSIBILITY
		Each class has a single purpose.
	OPEN-CLOSED:
		Every part should be open for other parts but encapsulate
		their own behaviour and protects its code.
	LISKOV SUBSTITUTION:
		Calling the behaviour of a child class via a parent-pointer
		should never lead to unexpected behaviour.
	INTERFACE SEGREGATION:
		Interfaces should be broken into as small parts as possible to
		prevent dependency on unused parts.
	DEPENDENCY INVERSION:
		Dependencies should flow from abstract to concrete parts,
		from parent to child classes, from interfaces to implementations.
